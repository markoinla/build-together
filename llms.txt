> Build Together is a lightweight, self-hosted project management tool built for AI+Human collaboration. It features a web interface, a RESTful API, and full Model Context Protocol (MCP) support for integration with AI coding assistants like Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf.

Build Together allows you to create and manage projects, organize work into sprints, track tasks and issues, and collaborate with AI assistants through natural language. The application is designed to be simple to set up and use, with a focus on providing a smooth experience for both human users and AI assistants.

Key features:
- Create and manage projects with requirements and implementation details
- Organize work into sprints with different statuses (Planned, Active, Completed)
- Track tasks and issues with completion status
- Star important tasks and issues for quick identification
- RESTful API for all operations
- MCP server for AI assistant integration

### Tips for AI Assistants

1. **Working with Tasks and Issues**: When a user asks you to "work on tasks or issues," you should:
   - List all tasks or issues using `list_tasks` or `list_issues` with the appropriate sprint_id
   - Focus on implementing or providing solutions for these tasks or issues

2. **Project Context**: Always maintain context about the current project structure:
   - Which project is the user working on?
   - What sprints exist in this project?
   - What tasks and issues are in the current sprint?

3. **Natural Language Processing**: Common user requests and their MCP tool mappings:
   - "Show me all projects" → `list_projects`
   - "Create a new sprint" → `create_sprint`
   - "Mark this task as complete" → `update_task` with completed=true
   - "Mark this issue as resolved" → `update_issue` with completed=true

4. **Error Handling**: If an MCP command fails:
   - Check if the referenced ID exists
   - Verify all required parameters are provided
   - Ensure parameter values are valid (e.g., sprint status must be one of: "Planned", "Active", "Completed")
   - Make sure you're using the correct parameter names (e.g., "details" for task and issue content, not "title" or "description")

5. **Workflow Suggestions**: Recommend efficient workflows to users:
   - Create projects with clear requirements
   - Organize work into sprints with specific goals
   - Use tasks for planned work and issues for problems that arise
   - Update tasks and issues as work progresses

## Executing MCP Commands

To execute an MCP command, send a POST request to the MCP server endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3149/mcp/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "list_projects",
    "parameters": {}
  }' | python -m json.tool
```

For AI assistants with direct MCP integration (like Windsurf or Cursor), you can use the natural language interface to issue commands, and the assistant will handle the MCP protocol details.

## Known Limitations

1. AI assistants may sometimes have trouble executing MCP commands or the MCP server might require multiple tool calls
2. Copy task/issue ID functionality doesn't work within Windsurf Browser Preview
3. Various UX/UI improvements are planned for future releases

## Best Practices

1. Always verify the success of operations by checking the response
2. Maintain context about the project structure to avoid unnecessary API calls
3. Use descriptive titles and detailed descriptions for all items
4. Leverage Markdown formatting in description fields for better readability
5. Star important tasks and issues to make them stand out
